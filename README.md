azure-client-upload
===================

A Proof of Concept to upload files to Azure Storage using the client, inspired on this blog post: http://coderead.wordpress.com/2012/11/21/uploading-files-directly-to-blob-storage-from-the-browser/

*If you wanna try this, you will also need to configure the CORS for the blob in order to allow cross origin request. I made a grunt task here: https://github.com/matiasdecarli/grunt-azure-blobs-acl
